<h3><strong>I can&#8217;t resist Easter eggs</strong></h3>
<p>They&#8217;re delicious.</p>
<p>Some (read: none) of you out there probably wonder what I do when I&#8217;m not working on Blasted Science posts or delaying the completion of our first video. There are a few answers to that, but I can almost guarantee that my unorthodox partying style is <em>not</em> popular reading material. But when I&#8217;m not writing or slacking off, I&#8217;m pretending to be Cicada 3301.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t start mashing those arrow keys on our home page: this secret ain&#8217;t a simple Konami cheat code. There&#8217;s a long, complicated series of steps that will eventually lead to something. But we&#8217;re not as smart as Cicada; anyone with a web browser and a few megabytes of disk space could probably figure it out. Will there be a reward for finding the Easter egg? That&#8217;s a very good question. Hopefully I can scrape together some funds before anyone finds it.</p>
<h3><strong>What you need to know</strong></h3>
<p>Randomly throwing you into the fray without a few useless hints? We aren&#8217;t that savage. These bullet points are your Bible from now on:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have a serious addiction to cryptography. Scratch that, I have an addiction to a word that is closely related to cryptography and sounds like a dinosaur. The name of that dinosaur is important.</li>
<li>No password is completely arbitrary, but I doubt you&#8217;ll get many on the first try.</li>
<li>No password is cheap. Don&#8217;t worry, they&#8217;re all lowercase and fairly short.</li>
<li>A recent post of ours has a screenshot of a web browser. It was completely accidental, but it might be helpful to those of you who don&#8217;t immediately guess the first step.</li>
<li>To those who don&#8217;t like downloading lots of sketchy software, I have bad news for you. [Update: read some of our newer posts]</li>
<li>There is one point where you have to google [something] + &#8220;easter egg&#8221; and the solution should be one of the first results.</li>
<li>&lt;3 imgur and pastebin</li>
</ul>
<p>That&#8217;s all you need to know! We wish you good luck. Now go break your legs and knock yourself out.</p>
