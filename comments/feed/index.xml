Spot.IM Sucks real bad. There is some feature that is causing Townhall and others to switch. I can’t imagine what it is but the feature has to be about site revenue generation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Spot.im sucks.   If you are a troll you might love it because there is no way to block annoying posters.  Town Hall.com recently switched to it and it is now overrun by trolls who are there just to provoke.  

The screen will jump around when it adds new comments which makes reading difficult.  It also disrupts typing of new posts. 

As far as I am concerned, there is nothing good about it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Spot.IM is like a little kindergarten version of Disqus. It&#039;s not as nearly as robust as Disqus and lacks so many functionalities that Disqus has. Companies are letting themselves be tricked into believing that somehow Spot.IM is better. It is not!

Two of my favorite sites have switched to Spot.IM. I don&#039;t even bother reading them any more.]]></description>
