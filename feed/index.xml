										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A new website from the creator of Blasted Science</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1.png" alt="Game Asset Screenshot" width="1280" height="507" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1.png 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1-1024x405.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1-400x158.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>I’ve been making video games since I was in elementary school. My game dev career culminated in the game <a href="http://memetownusa.com/">Memetown USA</a>, which I released on Steam in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to make an entire game by myself. I simply didn’t have the time to create all the sprites, textures, models, music, and sound effects by myself. Instead, I resorted to using pre-made assets I found online.</p>
<p>This proved to be a big challenge. First of all, I had a budget of $0, which meant I could only use assets available for free. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to find high-quality free assets; many of them are scattered around the internet on small personal websites, without any easy way to locate them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the licenses attached to these assets almost always requires attribution, which I personally find annoying. I found it too tedious to keep track of the author of every tiny sound effect used in my game, so, for the most part, I only used public domain assets — ones that lack any form of copyright. Unfortunately, public domain game assets aren’t easy to find! Very few exist, and the ones that do are generally low quality. I decided to change that.</p>
<h2>Finally, a solution!</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/911100/view/2935743950708195896">I dedicated Memetown USA to the public domain</a>, meaning that all my code, art, music, etc. is freely available online and can be used for any purpose. I hope my content can help other small-time game developers in their work. I also want to make it easy for other developers to contribute to the public domain.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I created <a href="http://gameasset.org/">GameAsset.org</a> — it’s a site where anyone can upload their creative work and dedicate it to the public domain. It’s intentionally designed to be a smooth, simple, and streamlined process with no strings attached. All you need is an account and then you can upload your assets to the site in just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-915 size-full" title="Game Asset Homepage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2.png" alt="Game Asset Homepage" width="1280" height="632" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2.png 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2-300x148.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2-1024x506.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2-400x198.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, the site has a powerful search functionality so that creators can easily locate exactly the type of asset they are looking for.</p>
<p>If you’re a game developer in need of free assets, or if you have assets that you can add to the public domain, I highly encourage giving my site a look. I’m sure my site will help you out!</p>

<h1>Where did we go?</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s been a long time since Blasted Science has posted any new content. Why is that?</p>
<p>Long story short, the group unofficially disbanded after high school when we each went our separate ways. Some of us went to college while others served missions for <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</a></p>
<h2>Will this site ever get updated again?</h2>
<p>We have no plans to update this site anymore. I&#8217;ll probably keep the site running for as long as I can afford it. However, don&#8217;t expect any content updates. I&#8217;m currently focused on other projects (like <a href="http://memetownusa.com/">Memetown USA</a> and <a href="http://gameasset.org/">GameAsset.org</a>) and don&#8217;t have time to update this site anymore.</p>
<p>Follow the individual members of Blasted Science on social media if you want to stay updated on our future projects. Thanks to everyone who supported us in our wildly dangerous science escapades! &lt;3</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay, maybe it isn&#8217;t <em>that</em> new of a video, but at least we&#8217;re finally getting around to posting it on this site.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in our last video, our rocket engines don&#8217;t work very well on their own. They have zero aerodynamics and mostly just spin around randomly in the air like an untied balloon. In this video, we explain the basic principles of rocket body design and demonstrate how to make one out of cardboard. It&#8217;s ridiculously easy.</p>
<p>When making these rockets, keep in mind that they are extremely finicky and precise; many rocket will fail before you get one to work. Even at our peak, we weren&#8217;t able to get more than about 50% of our rockets to fly well. Make sure your rocket body is well-designed!</p>

<p>These engines work great if you build them right. However, we stress the importance of precision. In particular, make sure the end caps and nozzle are made perfectly, otherwise you&#8217;ll have a flare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blasted Science has finally released their top-secret napalm recipe. Now anyone can make it! Spoiler warning: it&#8217;s super easy.</p>
<p>Napalm is a thick jelly made from styrofoam and gasoline that burns hot and long. It&#8217;s also terrible for the environment; don&#8217;t breathe in the dirty, black smoke unless you&#8217;re ready to die.</p>
<p>Previously, napalm was hidden from the general public. Only the most talented of scientists could make it. Now you can make napalm just like the pros!</p>

<p>The thing we cracked open is a big light from inside a projector TV. They are full of juice.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t recommend spilling any on your driveway as it takes days to disappear. Don&#8217;t drink it either.</p>

<p>This is hands-down the easiest way to make a Jacob&#8217;s Ladder, period. All you need is an old TV and a death wish.</p>
<h3><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3D4caz-c3PI" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></h3>
<p>The actual tutorial in the video is quite subtle, so here&#8217;s a written explanation of exactly what we did:</p>
<h3><strong>Instructions:</strong></h3>
<ol>
<li>Take apart a CRT TV. Be careful! They can implode if you crack the glass.</li>
<li>Rip the circuit board out. This will probably require cutting a few wires.</li>
<li>Plug it into the wall, and turn it on. You should hear a high-pitched noise. This is the part where you be EXTREMELY careful.</li>
<li>Two of the biggest (usually red) wires will arc up to a few centimeters. These are the wires you want. Don&#8217;t get your bare skin near them. Keep your left hand behind your back at all times.</li>
<li>Hook the two arcing wires up to a pair of metal rods that are in a long V-shape. Voila! That&#8217;s all there is to it.</li>
</ol>
<p>You might have to initiate the spark by putting something metal between the two wires at the bottom.</p>
<p>DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. A SINGLE MISTAKE WILL KILL YOU. The electricity is powerful enough to instantly kill you. Would not recommend.</p>
