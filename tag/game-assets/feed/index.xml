										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>A new website from the creator of Blasted Science</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-916" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1.png" alt="Game Asset Screenshot" width="1280" height="507" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1.png 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1-300x119.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1-1024x405.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/gameasset-screenshot-1-400x158.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>I’ve been making video games since I was in elementary school. My game dev career culminated in the game <a href="http://memetownusa.com/">Memetown USA</a>, which I released on Steam in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to make an entire game by myself. I simply didn’t have the time to create all the sprites, textures, models, music, and sound effects by myself. Instead, I resorted to using pre-made assets I found online.</p>
<p>This proved to be a big challenge. First of all, I had a budget of $0, which meant I could only use assets available for free. Unfortunately, it’s difficult to find high-quality free assets; many of them are scattered around the internet on small personal websites, without any easy way to locate them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the licenses attached to these assets almost always requires attribution, which I personally find annoying. I found it too tedious to keep track of the author of every tiny sound effect used in my game, so, for the most part, I only used public domain assets — ones that lack any form of copyright. Unfortunately, public domain game assets aren’t easy to find! Very few exist, and the ones that do are generally low quality. I decided to change that.</p>
<h2>Finally, a solution!</h2>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/911100/view/2935743950708195896">I dedicated Memetown USA to the public domain</a>, meaning that all my code, art, music, etc. is freely available online and can be used for any purpose. I hope my content can help other small-time game developers in their work. I also want to make it easy for other developers to contribute to the public domain.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I created <a href="http://gameasset.org/">GameAsset.org</a> — it’s a site where anyone can upload their creative work and dedicate it to the public domain. It’s intentionally designed to be a smooth, simple, and streamlined process with no strings attached. All you need is an account and then you can upload your assets to the site in just a few clicks.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-915 size-full" title="Game Asset Homepage" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2.png" alt="Game Asset Homepage" width="1280" height="632" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2.png 1280w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2-300x148.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2-1024x506.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2021/07/game-asset-screenshot-2-400x198.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" /></p>
<p>Additionally, the site has a powerful search functionality so that creators can easily locate exactly the type of asset they are looking for.</p>
<p>If you’re a game developer in need of free assets, or if you have assets that you can add to the public domain, I highly encourage giving my site a look. I’m sure my site will help you out!</p>
