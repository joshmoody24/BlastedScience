										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blasted Science has been busy perfecting a cheap and simple rocket design. In this video, we explain how to make the rocket engines from scratch.</p>
<p>These engines work great if you build them right. However, we stress the importance of precision. In particular, make sure the end caps and nozzle are made perfectly, otherwise you&#8217;ll have a flare.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Blasted Science has finally released their top-secret napalm recipe. Now anyone can make it! Spoiler warning: it&#8217;s super easy.</p>
<p>Napalm is a thick jelly made from styrofoam and gasoline that burns hot and long. It&#8217;s also terrible for the environment; don&#8217;t breathe in the dirty, black smoke unless you&#8217;re ready to die.</p>
<p>Previously, napalm was hidden from the general public. Only the most talented of scientists could make it. Now you can make napalm just like the pros!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Build Your Own Tablet</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone always has a complaint about their iPad or, for that matter, any other tablet (we just prefer to roast the iPad in particular). Having trouble finding a good tablet? Trick question, there are none. You&#8217;ll have to make your own. Before you even take another step </span><b>this will cost money</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We know this breaks our own rules, but it&#8217;s unavoidable. Sadly, even Blasted Science can’t build a good tablet with parts found in a dumpster.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-263" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablet-812708_960_720.png" alt="Tablet Cartoon" width="851" height="720" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablet-812708_960_720.png 851w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablet-812708_960_720-300x254.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tablet-812708_960_720-400x338.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px" />Being the master of electronics and engineering that we are we decided we should share our knowledge and wisdom with those of you at home who may not be so gifted. That doesn&#8217;t mean you; you must be smart because you&#8217;re reading this. Just tell everyone you know that they do not have the knowledge of the all-powerful Blasted Science to help them along the journey of life. we have done the research and we know we can make the most powerful tablet you have ever seen. We have decided that the best way to do this is a step by step process, so here it goes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Do some research. It is important to have a good idea of what you want. Find a tablet that you would want and absorb all of the knowledge from the reviews. The details and specs are useless only go to reviews, preferably reviews written by people who have not bought the product.</li>
<li>Buy it. To make the tablet that fits you you will have to test it out and see what you like. While the reviews may be a very good source you are better. Test it out for a month all the while making a list of the things you do and don&#8217;t like.</li>
<li>Destroy it. You can&#8217;t be tethered to these Earthly objects when going through the process of engineering. I recommend meditation to get the clear mind that is necessary when destroying to rebuild. The destruction process is really important. You must open it up take out all the electronics in the case then use a sledgehammer to gently destroy it. Keep the case it will be important later.</li>
<li>Buy a new one. Now that you have that list of things you do and do not like buy one that fits those criteria. Once you have one that you know you like move on to the next step.</li>
<li>Take out the insides. We are still making our own.</li>
<li>Get the case out from earlier. Get the case and stuff the electronics from your new one in the old one. If it doesn&#8217;t fit then just saw off one side, it&#8217;ll probably still work.</li>
<li>Clickbait. Take out your 1000 DEGREE GLOWING KNIFE and slice the second tablet&#8217;s casing. YOU WON&#8217;T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT, ONLY 3% OF PEOPLE CAN SEE THE FUMES THAT IT EMITS! DO THE FUMES CONTRIBUTE TO GLOBAL WARMING??????</li>
<li>ENJOY! You are so welcome for the new and improved tablet.</li>
</ol>
<p>We at Blasted Science accept tips, and welcome you to contact us and we will give you the opportunity to donate to us.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Onion Omega2</strong></h2>
<p>The Omega2 is one of those increasingly popular single-board computers. It made its debut on Kickstarter last year. Is it any good?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be up-front about it. I&#8217;m not the target market for the Omega2. It&#8217;s similar to a Raspberry Pi Zero, but with one big difference: the Zero is designed for, well, doing a lot of things. The Omega2 is designed for IoT. Blasted Science has absolutely no interest in IoT whatsoever, but the price tag was absolutely irresistible at $5.</p>
<p>Actually, the version I&#8217;m reviewing is the $9 &#8220;Plus&#8221; version. The only difference is that the Plus variant has double the RAM and storage. This review should apply equally well to both models, though. Here&#8217;s the spec sheet:</p>
<div id="attachment_662" style="width: 690px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-specs.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-662" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-662" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-specs.png" alt="Omega2 Specs" width="680" height="943" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-specs.png 680w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-specs-216x300.png 216w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-specs-288x400.png 288w" sizes="(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-662" class="wp-caption-text">Slower than the Pi Zero, but you don&#8217;t buy these for speed, right?</p></div>
<h3><strong>Shipping Woes</strong></h3>
<p>For a brief time, I was very disappointed in Onion&#8217;s shipping ability. It had been more than a month longer than they promised and I still hadn&#8217;t gotten our Omega2. However, it turns out it wasn&#8217;t their problem. I had forgotten to fill out the delivery form on Kickstarter. Oops. My bad.</p>
<h3><strong>Setup</strong></h3>
<p>The Omega2 was much more difficult to setup than I thought. To power it via MicroUSB, you need dock, purchased separately. The dock costs twice as much as the computer itself, which is a big disappointment. If the Pi Zero can incorporate USB and keep the price under $5, it seems inexcusable to make it an add-on feature for $10. Being a tightwad, I passed on buying it and decided to build my own power supply. I already had all the parts except one: a voltage regular. <a href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/711-53200-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&amp;ipn=icep&amp;toolid=20004&amp;campid=5338034714&amp;mpre=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F10pcs-LM1117T-3-3-LM1117T-LD1117-3-3V-TO-220-Voltage-Regulator-TW-%2F131570795922%3Fhash%3Ditem1ea23b0592%3Ag%3AW0EAAOSwMmBVwBph">I found a pack of 10 on Ebay for cheap.</a></p>
<p>The power supply isn&#8217;t complicated at all, and is <a href="https://docs.onion.io/omega2-docs/hardware-prep-no-dock.html">well documented.</a> However, it still gave me a bunch of problems, which once again were likely my fault. The Omega2 would start booting up, but the power light would turn off after 10-20 seconds. After spending hours trying to isolate the problem, I discovered it was my power supply. As a quick hack, I swapped out a broken-out phone charger with 4 AA batteries. Success!</p>
<div id="attachment_655" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Power-supply.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-655" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-655" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Power-supply-1024x683.jpg" alt="Power Supply" width="800" height="534" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Power-supply-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Power-supply-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Power-supply-400x267.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Power-supply.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-655" class="wp-caption-text">My messy, homemade Omega2 power supply. It&#8217;s simpler than it looks.</p></div>
<p>The setup process is surprisingly simple and well-designed. You interact with the Omega2 via another computer; connecting it to the Omega2 via Wifi. You simply point your web browser at a specific IP address and the setup can begin. All you have to do is give it your Wifi password, and you&#8217;re done. Optionally, you can update your device&#8217;s firmware and install the &#8220;console&#8221;. After that, you&#8217;re ready to begin using it.</p>
<h3><strong>Usage</strong></h3>
<p>One advantage the Omega2 has over any Raspberry Pi is that it comes with 32Mb of storage (64Mb for the Plus); this allows it to run a full Linux installation out of the box, no microSD card required. While it&#8217;s by no means a sizable amount of storage, it&#8217;s enough for basic functionality. Fortunately, it does have a microSD slot.</p>
<div id="attachment_656" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega-2-underside.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-656" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-656" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega-2-underside-1024x683.jpg" alt="Omega2 Underside" width="800" height="534" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega-2-underside-1024x683.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega-2-underside-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega-2-underside-400x267.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega-2-underside.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-656" class="wp-caption-text">The underside of the Omega2</p></div>
<p>You can interact with the Omega2 via SSH or serial, but I didn&#8217;t try either one. The simplest method of interaction is via the same IP address used for setup. If you choose to install the console, you get a good-looking web interface loaded with a few useful apps.</p>
<div id="attachment_660" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onion-console.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-660" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-660" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onion-console-1024x597.jpg" alt="Onion Console" width="800" height="466" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onion-console-1024x597.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onion-console-300x175.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onion-console-400x233.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/onion-console.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-660" class="wp-caption-text">Kinda reminds me of Ubuntu</p></div>
<p>To reiterate, I have no interest in actually using this device for IoT. I poked around the various apps, but have no real use for any of it. I did install Python and test a few lines of code, but that&#8217;s been the extent of my testing so far.</p>
<h3><strong>The Bottom Line</strong></h3>
<p>The Omega2 is a well-designed, low-cost Raspberry Pi competitor, although its cheap price rises quickly with the addition of basically-required accessories. It&#8217;s also pretty good at doing IoT things. Probably. I wouldn&#8217;t know. But it&#8217;s cool. It made a fine addition to my collection.</p>
<div id="attachment_658" style="width: 810px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-c.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-658" decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="size-large wp-image-658" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-c-1024x740.jpg" alt="Onion Omega2" width="800" height="578" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-c-1024x740.jpg 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-c-300x217.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-c-400x289.jpg 400w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/02/omega2-c.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-658" class="wp-caption-text">A pretty snazzy little machine. I bet it works just fine.</p></div>
<p>Various accessories for the Omega2 can be purchased at the official <a href="https://onion.io/store/">store.</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We don&#8217;t feel like we covered everything last time. Here are five more dangerous tools you can make from ordinary household items. Poke your eye out, kid.</p>
<p><span id="more-487"></span></p>
<h3><b>5. Spaghetti</b></h3>
<p>A thermic lance is a heavy-duty demolition tool that burns steel alloys and aluminum in pressurized oxygen to create temperatures hot enough to cut… anything, really. Instead of burning steel, this do-it-yourself version uses spaghetti as fuel.</p>
<p>Spaghetti may not seem particularly flammable, but with pure oxygen just about everything becomes a pyromaniac’s dream. With just an oxygen tank, aluminum foil, and a small handful of spaghetti, you can make a thermic lance that burns hot enough to melt through concrete.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/-sEdHh1Xjb0" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Thermic lances are used in construction and demolition to cut large pieces of steel. This homemade version can get hot enough to melt metal. All you have to do is hook up one side of a small hose to an oxygen tank and attach a small amount of spaghetti wrapped in aluminum foil to the other. Igniting the spaghetti in the oxygen-rich tube produces a crazy-hot flame, creating the cheapest steel-melting lance you&#8217;ll ever see.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Blasted Science has constructed their own thermic lance. However, ours never runs out of oxygen. Instead of a tank, we hooked it up to an oxygen generator for longer burning.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-496" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thermic-Lance-1.gif" alt="Thermic Lance" width="360" height="360" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. Ammonia</b></p>
<p>Ammonia itself can be dangerous (inhalation not recommended), but when combined with iodine, the extremely volatile explosive Nitrogen Triiodide is formed. Touching it with just about anything is enough to make it explode.</p>
<p>All you need is ammonium hydroxide, easily purchased as a household cleaner, and iodine crystals, easily purchased online. Simply dissolve the iodine crystals in the ammonium hydroxide and wait a few hours. Pour the resulting liquid over filter paper to collect the explosive. Be careful: even though the compound is more stable while in solution, it can still potentially explode while dissolved.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0nOikC5W3U8" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Nitrogen Triiodide has no practical use, due to its extreme sensitivity to friction, but it can certainly be entertaining. Be extremely careful with these crystals; the slightest touch and you can kiss your fingers goodbye. It’s recommended that you start small, and work your way up to bigger amounts once you know what you’re doing.</p>
<p>Blasted Science attempted to make Nitrogren Triiodide, but our iodine samples weren&#8217;t nearly pure enough for it to work.  Sticking live wires into a bottle filled with iodized salt water probably wasn&#8217;t the best way to obtain iodine.</p>
<h3><b>3. Etch-a-Sketch</b></h3>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/etch-a-sketch.jpg"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-542 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/etch-a-sketch-e1479857567215.jpg" alt="Etch a Sketch" width="512" height="512" /></a></p>
<p>This common toy is loaded with powdered aluminum. Aluminum, sadly, doesn&#8217;t burn. Unless it&#8217;s combined with rust, that is.</p>
<p>Mixing powdered aluminum and iron oxide (rust) in the correct ratio, three parts iron oxide to one part aluminum, creates thermite. Thermite isn&#8217;t explosive, but burns at insanely high temperatures and produces iron. However, it also requires insanely high temperatures to ignite; a normal flame won’t do it. Using a sparkler is an easy way to get it started. Never ignite thermite near yourself; it spews molten metal all over the place. You don’t want to be anywhere near it once it’s lit.</p>
<p>After the time of writing (this list has been in limbo for a long time), Grant Thompson and Cody&#8217;s Lab successfully created thermite from an Etch-a-Sketch. The video from Cody&#8217;s Lab goes into greater detail on their project.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Mbk7ijNQlMc" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Thermite burns at well above 4,000° Fahrenheit: hot enough to melt through things not usually considered meltable, such as dirt. Good luck finding a container that can hold it. Most commonly, ceramic containers are used, such as flowerpots. Surprisingly, it is 100% legal to own and use. Have fun.</p>
<h3><b>2. Drain Cleaner</b></h3>
<p>Drain cleaner, aluminum foil, and a pop bottle are used to make what is called a “Drano bomb.” Combining drain cleaner (sodium hydroxide) and aluminum foil produces hydrogen gas. If the reaction occurs in a sealed bottle, the pressure will increase until the bottle explodes.</p>
<p>Using drain cleaner to make bottle bombs can be very dangerous. The explosion can cause chemical burns and the loss of fingers. For this device in particular, please be mature. These bombs are often left in people’s yards and mailboxes, and can cause severe damage to people and property. Be extremely careful with explosives and never use them to harm anyone or anything.</p>
<p>Alternatively, try stretching a balloon over the mouth of the bottle. The balloon will fill with hydrogen gas, which is lighter than helium and extremely flammable. Try lighting the balloon with a match, even a small balloon will make a sizeable explosion. You&#8217;ll definitely want to wear thick gloves while lighting it.</p>

<p>Blasted Science can confirm that this works very well. Unfortunately, our video has become corrupted, and our only evidence is the single photograph above.</p>
<h3><b>1. Lantern Battery</b></h3>
<p>Using a power supply built from microwave oven transformers, the carbon rods in lantern batteries happen to work perfectly as electrodes in a miniature electric arc furnace hot enough to turn metal and rocks into molten goop.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/VTzKIs19eZE" width="560" height="314" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The entire process is detailed by Grant Thompson in one of his most dangerous DIY projects to date. This project is a bit more complicated than the rest: you’ll need to use the transformers from a pair of microwaves to convert the electricity from your house into a current capable of forming an arc. But the effort is well worth it. With a couple of microwaves, pliers, carbon rods, and a block of firebrick, you can make a forge capable of melting just about everything imaginable.</p>
<p>However, all that power comes at the price of serious danger. This is easily the most dangerous item on this list. You’ll be dealing with electricity, extremely high temperatures, toxic fumes, and molten metal. Because of this, take appropriate safety measures. This project is not for the faint of heart.</p>
<p>Once again, Blasted Science has constructed their own version of this. However, it deserves more than just a mention in a list. Expect more information on our arc furnace in the future.</p>
