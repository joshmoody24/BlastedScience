<p>As an official member of &#8220;The Media,&#8221; we are legally obligated to share every single one of our political opinions with you.</p>
<p>Blasted Science has, thus far, remained politically neutral on every issue. However, it is impossible for a media organization to ignore its conscience forever. There are quite a few controversial issues in America at the moment, and Blasted Science has a strong opinion about <em>every single one.</em></p>
<h2><strong>Where We Stand on the Issues</strong></h2>
<h3>Gun Control</h3>
<p>Guns should be banned. However, it should be legally required for everyone over the age of eight to carry a class IIIb laser weapon on them at all times and its use should be entirely unregulated.</p>
<h3>Health Care</h3>
<p>Every component of the human body should be replaced with a robotic counterpart. The extra durability this provides should reduce the need of health care. At that point, heck, let the government foot the bill. It&#8217;ll probably cost like eight bucks a month <em>total.</em></p>
<h3>Abortion</h3>
<p>Human children are annoying and should be replaced with mechanical versions as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Blasted Science refuses to recognize as legitimate any country that meets one or more of the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has the letter A in its name.</li>
<li>Is smaller than Texas.</li>
<li>Has a leader with at least one X chromosome.</li>
<li>The local dialect pronounces the word &#8220;robot&#8221; like <em>row-baht</em> instead of <em>row-bit.</em></li>
<li>Is purple on any popular world map.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Homeland Security</h3>
<p>A government should never spy on its citizens. However, it is acceptable as a hobby if the NSA ever gets bored.</p>
<h3>Free Trade</h3>
<p>Free trade is fine. Great, even. So long as it&#8217;s the <em>United States</em> that&#8217;s getting the stuff for free. It&#8217;d be a lousy deal if we had to <em>pay</em> for the goods. Let Canada do that.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>It should come as no surprise to intelligent readers that, based on the information above, Blasted Science is a proud supporter of the <a href="http://www.zoltanistvan.com/TranshumanistParty.html">Transhumanist Party.</a></p>

<p>We political folk at Blasted Science be liking the idea of people robots. That is all.</p>
