<p>This has absolutely nothing to do with science but&#8230;</p>
<p><em>People need to know.</em></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quarterly-Report2.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-605" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quarterly-Report2-1024x720.png" alt="Quarterly Report" width="800" height="563" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quarterly-Report2.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quarterly-Report2-300x211.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Quarterly-Report2-400x281.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a>Quarterly Report Q4 2016</strong></h3>
<p>Astute followers of Blasted Science may have noticed a long period of time between posts…again. This time we have an excuse, though.</p>
<p>As every reputable company does, we have prepared a transparency report. Blasted Science is not above the scrutiny of the law. We are real company doing business thing?</p>
<h3><strong>Preliminary Item I: Videos are Hard</strong></h3>
<p>We at Blasted Science have been hard at work laying the groundwork for our push into video content. As one may expect, quality videos take an unreasonably long time to make. We&#8217;re doing our best to streamline the process, and are making great strides.</p>
<p>In fact, we can prove it! We&#8217;ve made two videos so far, and a third is on the way. Head over to our <a href="/video-gallery">videos</a> page to check them out. They&#8217;re quality. Trust us.</p>
<h3><strong>Preliminary Item II: Lack of New Content</strong></h3>
<blockquote><p>If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.</p>
<p>-Russian Proverb</p></blockquote>
<p>Preliminary Item II is not a valid concern. We have been continually churning out content for months. The only difference between recent months and older ones is the <em>type of content. </em>Recently, we have focused our efforts entirely on video production. We have limited resources and can&#8217;t spend our time writing <em>and</em> filming, which is why the site hasn&#8217;t been updated consistently. We&#8217;re doing our best to strike a balance between the different types of content.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that last bit. We absolutely <em>could</em> do both at the same time. The only problem is that three-quarters of us don&#8217;t do anything. Proof:</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/postGraph.png"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-594" src="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/postGraph.png" alt="Posts by Author" width="580" height="400" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/postGraph.png 580w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/postGraph-300x207.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/01/postGraph-400x276.png 400w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></a>Perceptive readers may notice a minor problem in the above graph. There is a definite optimization problem. Most of our operations are executing on a single thread, and that thread is yours truly.</p>
<h4>Is there a solution?</h4>
<p>Probably. The best course of action would probably be a more specific separation of powers. With the exception of the <em>Editor-in-Chief</em> (bet you can&#8217;t guess who that is), there is no distinct role for anyone in Blasted Science. Changing that would be nice. This concludes the commentary.</p>
<h2><strong>Full Transparency Report</strong></h2>
<h4>Operations</h4>
<ul>
<li>Content production is currently at 40% of its average rate, but that is expected to change very soon.</li>
<li>Content production <em>quality</em> is at an all time high. Quality is much higher than originally expected.</li>
<li>Employee morale is acceptable.</li>
<li>Employee participation is at 25% of its theoretical maximum.</li>
<li>Blasted Science has completed preparations for their video content, and created two proof-of-concept videos. Investors&#8217; confidence in the company surged following both of these videos.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Revenue</h4>
<ul>
<li>Q4 2016 Gross Income: Zero thousand dollars.</li>
<li>Stock price has stabilized at NaN.</li>
<li>Site viewership has grown by 73.4% over Q3.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Company Progress</h4>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">As is well known, Blasted Science has long measured their progress with the following five phases:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Phase I: Site is created. Content creation begins.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Phase II: Content creation begins to reach the BS Quality Threshold<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />. Video creation begins.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Phase III: BS Quality Threshold<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" alt="™" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> is reached. Massive advertising campaign begins.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Phase IV: ???</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">Phase V: Profit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">During Q4 2016, Blasted Science reached Phase II. Phase III is expected to be during Q2 2017 at the latest.</p>
<h4>Plans for Q1 2017</h4>
<ul>
<li>Video production is set to ramp up significantly.</li>
<li>Preparation for Phase III begins.</li>
<li>Top-level reorganization. Executive staff expected to change roles.</li>
<li>Dumpster diving season begins.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This concludes our quarterly report. Thank you for your time. Blasted Science is always honored to be able to serve the public.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Since our site is very new, we've decided to outline our future plans, and schedule so that our readers have a better idea of what to expect.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since our site is very new, we&#8217;ve decided to outline our future plans, and schedule so that our readers have a better idea of what to expect:</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #000000;"><strong>Posts</strong></span></h3>
<p>We plan to add 1-2 major posts every week, with a few smaller ones every now and then. We have three general categories for posts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts featuring content from our YouTube videos.</li>
<li>Informational/tutorial posts on various DIY topics.</li>
<li>Completely off-the-wall, meaningless garbage that will make you question our ability to responsibly ingest alcohol.</li>
</ul>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>YouTube</strong></h3>
<p>Videos are hard work. We plan to regularly post 1-2 tutorial videos every month. However, it may take another month before we are able to post our first video. We&#8217;ve put a lot of work into setting up a website and YouTube channel. Please be patient while we finish wrapping it up.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Goals<br />
</strong></h3>
<p>We have a lot of ambitious goals for Blasted Science. We&#8217;ve compiled a checklist of some big milestones we hope to be able to achieve someday. Here they are, in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upload a YouTube video.</li>
<li>Get someone to comment on our site.</li>
<li>Get 500 views on our site daily.</li>
<li>Build an army of power-kiting DIY enthusiasts.</li>
<li>Rule the world with an iron fist.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully this has given you an idea of what to expect. We plan to create plenty of great content for you, hopefully with minimal casualties. Stay tuned for more danger than you can handle!</p>
