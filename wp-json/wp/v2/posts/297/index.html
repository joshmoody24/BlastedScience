But what are we?<\/h3>\n<p><!--more--><\/p>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re an extremely new site, you&#8217;re probably left with a few questions. Who are we? What do we do? Why should you care? Why haven&#8217;t you read the About page? It only took us a few weeks to find the answers to these questions.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Who Are We?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Go read the\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/about\">About page<\/a>. It&#8217;s not that hard. We put a lot of effort into the four-column thing. We&#8217;re too lazy to explain it again.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">What Do We Do?<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">That&#8217;s a better question.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">We are a small group of zero-budget, danger-prone DIY enthusiasts who manage to accomplish large-scale projects using minimal funds and equipment. We want nothing more than to share our knowledge with the world. Blasted Science is dedicated to providing you with the information you need to build awesome things without money.<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Oh, wait, that was on the About page! Silly us, writing that all over again. I&#8217;ve actually memorized that from typing it so many times.<\/p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Why Should You Care?<\/h2>\n<p>We make things. We find ways to build cool stuff from parts around the house. Obviously, we&#8217;re not the first people to do this, but we do it differently from the other guys. Here&#8217;s what differentiates us:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>We don&#8217;t spend money. <\/em>This is our big, distinguishing feature. Other DIY enthusiasts know how to <em>save<\/em> money, but they can&#8217;t avoid spending it altogether. We figure out how to build the same things with nothing but tools we already have, and we show you exactly how to do it, too.<\/li>\n<li>We know our stuff. We spend at least fifteen minutes researching before starting any major project. We can assure you that anything we do is scientifically sound and totally safe. Well, scientifically sound, at least.<\/li>\n<li>We completely throw caution to the wind. Safety costs money. Forget protective gear and welding goggles, we prefer cardboard blast shields and squinting. We highly recommend\u00a0<em>not<\/em> following in our footsteps, but the option is there.<\/li>\n<li>We can assure you that we&#8217;ll never use the proper tools for the job. Railroad spikes\u00a0are more than sufficient for any task.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><\/h2>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">Where Else Can You Find Us?<\/h2>\n<p>YouTube! That&#8217;s where the majority of our effort will go. We&#8217;ll do our best to update this site with new and interesting content, but we&#8217;re primarily a YouTube channel. You can find more information about our posting schedule <a href=\"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/information-about-our-plans-and-schedule\/\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>We also have social media accounts on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. We&#8217;ll keep each of these platforms updated with fresh and unique content.
