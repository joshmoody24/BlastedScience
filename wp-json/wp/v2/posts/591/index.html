This time we have an excuse, though.<\/p>\n<p>As every reputable company does, we have prepared a transparency report. Blasted Science is not above the scrutiny of the law. We are real company doing business thing?<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Preliminary Item I: Videos are Hard<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We at Blasted Science have been hard at work laying the groundwork for our push into video content. As one may expect, quality videos take an unreasonably long time to make. We&#8217;re doing our best to streamline the process, and are making great strides.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, we can prove it! We&#8217;ve made two videos so far, and a third is on the way. Head over to our <a href=\"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/video-gallery\">videos<\/a> page to check them out. They&#8217;re quality. Trust us.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Preliminary Item II: Lack of New Content<\/strong><\/h3>\n<blockquote><p>If you chase two rabbits, you will not catch either one.<\/p>\n<p>-Russian Proverb<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Preliminary Item II is not a valid concern. We have been continually churning out content for months. The only difference between recent months and older ones is the <em>type of content. <\/em>Recently, we have focused our efforts entirely on video production. We have limited resources and can&#8217;t spend our time writing\u00a0<em>and<\/em> filming, which is why the site hasn&#8217;t been updated consistently. We&#8217;re doing our best to strike a balance between the different types of content.<\/p>\n<p>Actually, scratch that last bit. We absolutely <em>could<\/em> do both at the same time. The only problem is that\u00a0three-quarters of us don&#8217;t do anything. Proof:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/postGraph.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-594\" src=\"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/postGraph.png\" alt=\"Posts by Author\" width=\"580\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/postGraph.png 580w, http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/postGraph-300x207.png 300w, http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/01\/postGraph-400x276.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/a>Perceptive readers may notice a minor problem in the above graph. There is a definite optimization problem. Most of our operations are executing on a single thread, and that thread is yours truly.<\/p>\n<h4>Is there a solution?<\/h4>\n<p>Probably. The best course of action would probably be a more specific separation of powers. With the exception of the <em>Editor-in-Chief<\/em> (bet you can&#8217;t guess who that is), there is no distinct role for anyone in Blasted Science. Changing that would be nice. This concludes the commentary.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Full Transparency Report<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h4>Operations<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Content production is currently at 40% of its average rate, but that is expected to change very soon.<\/li>\n<li>Content production <em>quality<\/em> is at an all time high. Quality is much higher than originally expected.<\/li>\n<li>Employee morale is acceptable.<\/li>\n<li>Employee participation is at 25% of its theoretical maximum.<\/li>\n<li>Blasted Science has completed preparations for their video content, and created two proof-of-concept videos. Investors&#8217; confidence in the company surged following both of these videos.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Revenue<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Q4 2016 Gross Income: Zero thousand dollars.<\/li>\n<li>Stock price has stabilized at NaN.<\/li>\n<li>Site viewership has grown by 73.4% over Q3.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Company Progress<\/h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">As is well known, Blasted Science has long measured their progress with the following five phases:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Phase I: Site is created.

Video creation begins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Phase III: BS Quality Threshold\u2122 is reached. Massive advertising campaign begins.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Phase IV: ???<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Phase V: Profit.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">During Q4 2016, Blasted Science reached Phase II.
