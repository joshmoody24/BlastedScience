We already have a great source, but a few experiences that make us not want to touch it. This great source is nuclear energy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Like we said earlier you probably don\u2019t like the sound of it, but the truth is nuclear energy is the bomb! Pun very intended. All jokes aside, nuclear energy is cleaner, safer, and more efficient than most people think. People terrified of the unknown. So let&#8217;s learn some things to make it known.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>How does it work?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Nuclear energy is created through a process called nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is just a fancy word for splitting apart a nuclear atom to acquire the desired superpower. Well half of that is true, I\u2019ll let you decide which half. This energy is in the form of heat which warms up some liquid, Blasted Science prefers Dr. Pepper, but we are only humble rocket scientists. When the Dr. Pepper is hot enough it will start making bubbles and will steam. It must be approximately 212 degrees Fahrenheit or if you live any other place but the United States 100 degrees Celsius. The best way to tell the temperature is to dive straight in it and time how long it takes to burn the flesh. Once you are nice and crispy then you know it is ready.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Safety Stuffs<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is safe, trust us. Don\u2019t question only obey. There are so many safety precautions that we don\u2019t know where to start. So we won\u2019t start. Instead we will loosely quote what pulled up on Google \u201cNuclear power is safe and continuing to get safer, so stop being a baby you\u2019re fine.\u201d That\u2019s what Google said, so if you don\u2019t trust us then trust them.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are constantly improving as a species. What is the point in improving barbaric ways of making energy if we could just switch to one that is way better? Blasted Science is not here to tell you that you are wrong, unless of course you are, but we do want to inform you. We think you should form your own opinion, and as long as it is the same as ours you should voice it.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Too many people are whining about the use of nuclear power.
