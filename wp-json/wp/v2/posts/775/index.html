Technically it breaks after five seconds, but hey, maybe yours won&#8217;t.<\/p>\n<p>This is hands-down the easiest way to make a Jacob&#8217;s Ladder, period. All you need is an old TV and a death wish.<\/p>\n<h3><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/3D4caz-c3PI\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/h3>\n<p>The actual tutorial in the video is quite subtle, so here&#8217;s a written explanation of exactly what we did:<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Instructions:<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Take apart a CRT TV. Be careful! They can implode if you crack the glass.<\/li>\n<li>Rip the circuit board out. This will probably require cutting a few wires.<\/li>\n<li>Plug it into the wall, and turn it on. You should hear a high-pitched noise. This is the part where you be EXTREMELY careful.<\/li>\n<li>Two of the biggest (usually red) wires will arc up to a few centimeters. These are the wires you want. Don&#8217;t get your bare skin near them. Keep your left hand behind your back at all times.<\/li>\n<li>Hook the two arcing wires up to a pair of metal rods that are in a long V-shape. Voila! That&#8217;s all there is to it.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You might have to initiate the spark by putting something metal between the two wires at the bottom.<\/p>\n<p>DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. A SINGLE MISTAKE WILL KILL YOU. The electricity is powerful enough to instantly kill you. Would not recommend.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is hands-down the easiest way to make a Jacob&#8217;s Ladder, period.
