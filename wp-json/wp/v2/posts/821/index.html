They have zero aerodynamics and mostly just spin around randomly in the air like an untied balloon. In this video, we explain the basic principles of rocket body design and demonstrate how to make one out of cardboard. It&#8217;s ridiculously easy.<\/p>\n<p>When making these rockets, keep in mind that they are extremely finicky and precise; many rocket will fail before you get one to work. Even at our peak, we weren&#8217;t able to get more than about 50% of our rockets to fly well. Make sure your rocket body\u00a0is well-designed!<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/F5UbYzM67ng\" width=\"560\" height=\"314\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In this video, we explain the basic principles of rocket body design and demonstrate how to make a simple one out of cardboard.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":820,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"categories":[64],"tags":[59,72,70],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/821"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=821"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/821\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":825,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/821\/revisions\/825"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/820"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=821"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=821"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/blastedscience.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=821"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
